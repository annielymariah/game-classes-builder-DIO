# üõ°Ô∏è Game Classes Builder üèπ

## Description

This project is a solution to the "Escrevendo as classes de um Jogo" challenge proposed by the DIO.me course. The objective is to create a generic `Hero` class representing a character in an adventure game, with properties like name, age, and type (e.g., warrior, mage, monk, ninja). Additionally, the class must have an `attack` method that displays a message based on the hero's type, showing what attack they used.

## Challenge Requirements

The `Hero` class must meet the following requirements:

- **Properties**:
  - `name` (string): The hero's name.
  - `age` (number): The hero's age.
  - `type` (string): The hero's type (e.g., "warrior", "mage", "monk", "ninja").
  
- **Methods**:
  - `attack()` (method): Displays the message:
    - `"The {type} attacked using {attack}"`
    - Where `{type}` is the hero's type (e.g., "warrior", "mage", etc.).
    - `{attack}` will depend on the hero's type:
      - **mage** ‚Üí `"used magic"`
      - **warrior** ‚Üí `"used a sword"`
      - **monk** ‚Üí `"used martial arts"`
      - **ninja** ‚Üí `"used a shuriken"`

## Expected Output

The output should be in the following format, based on the hero‚Äôs type:

- `"The {type} attacked using {attack}"`

For example:
- **Warrior**: `"The warrior attacked using a sword"`
- **Mage**: `"The mage attacked using magic"`
- **Monk**: `"The monk attacked using martial arts"`
- **Ninja**: `"The ninja attacked using a shuriken"`
